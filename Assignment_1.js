// TODO Ensure there are no TypeScript or ESLint errors
// TODO Styling is optional
// TODO Search on MDN for a way to make sections temporarily invisible.
// TODO The form consists of a subject and a body. Both of them are required for a successful submission.
// TODO If the user navigates away from the form, the inputs are cleared
// TODO Unread messages have a special styling

// DONE
// TODO Install TypeScript and ESLint via npm or pnpm
// TODO The navigation allows to switch between a form that allows to add messages and a list of all messages.
// TODO The messages link shows an unread messages count, however if there are more than 5, then "5+" is shown.
// TODO The form can be submitted by pressing enter in one of the input fields or by clicking a submit button (use built-in HTML features instead of JavaScript).
// TODO After a successful submission, the form is cleared and the focus moved back to the subject.
// TODO When there are no messages at all, a message should inform the user about it.
// TODO Don't use external libraries
// TODO A text at the top indicates the number of unread messages. When there are none, the text is hidden. Pluralize correctly: "You have one unread message.", "You have 2 unread messages." etc.
// TODO Messages are shown with their subject and body and are sorted by most recent on top
// TODO Implement a message board using JavaScript modules & classes
// TODO Clicking on an unread message marks it as read
